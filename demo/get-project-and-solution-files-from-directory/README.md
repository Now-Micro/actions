# Demo: get-project-and-solution-files-from-directory

This demo directory provides a variety of nested folders, solution files, project files, and unrelated files to exercise the action.

Structure highlights:
- SampleSolution.sln at root
- SolutionA with nested src and tests, including deep nesting containing a .csproj far below typical max depth
- SolutionB empty placeholder
- Random non-project files sprinkled through directories
