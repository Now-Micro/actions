# TODOS

- the way it should work:
    -- get-unique-project-directories should check if there is a .csproj file somewhere in the root directory when using the fallback approach (add input for this).  If not, then that path is removed
- fix test results not uploading

- things to test:
    -- removing whole dir
    -- make one test fail in a sub-project
