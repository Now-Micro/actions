- add outputs to get-project-and-solution-files-from-directory called project_name and solution_name
- add an input to allow for customization of the version used for [analyzers project](dotnet/coding-standards/analyzers/CodingStandards.Analyzers/CodingStandards.Analyzers.csproj) (currently "4.8.0").
- add a workflow for success case of demo-code-standards-success (create another solution to test; can copy failing one)
- need to copy stuff from AnalyzerReleases.UnShipped.md to AnalyzerReleases.Shipped.md (ask more about this)
- handle todo comments (search for 'todo:')

- make sure that CSharpier adheres to standards [here](https://github.com/Now-Micro/CodeBits/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- publish the newest from actions repo as v1 (regarding the get-unique-directories changes).  
    - test the new changes in code bits for #64 and #57
- what is the best way to handle view/node linting?
- document assumptions around linting (certain files have to be present) in a readme.md file in the action directory
