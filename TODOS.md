- need to revert commit on this pr: https://github.com/Now-Micro/CodeBits/pull/57
- refactor and add test + workflow: 
    -get-unique-root-directores
    -get-changed-directories
- how can I use existing actions to replace get-changed-directories?
- publish a new version
    - then refactor codebits to use actions
    - then refactor DICE to use actions
